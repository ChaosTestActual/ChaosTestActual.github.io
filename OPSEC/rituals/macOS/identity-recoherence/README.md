# macOS Identity Provisioning Rituals

This folder contains modular provisioning scripts for secure GPG + YubiKey setup under macOS.  
Each script performs a focused, idempotent step in the identity consecration process.

|--------|-------------|
| `ritual__install-prereqs.sh` | Installs Homebrew (if needed) and required packages: `gnupg`, `pinentry-mac`, `ykman`, `yubikey-agent`, `libfido2`. |

| `ritual__provision-key.sh` | Handles GPG key generation and subkey transfers across multiple YubiKeys. |
| `ritual__configure-git-and-ssh.sh` | Sets Git config (noreply email, GPG signing key), copies SSH pubkey to clipboard. |
| `ritual__finalize-and-export.sh` | Cleans up private key exports, copies relevant info to clipboard, and reminds user to upload keys. |
| `ritual__gpg-signing-fix.sh` | Patches Git + GPG signing issues (TTY, loopback pinentry). |
